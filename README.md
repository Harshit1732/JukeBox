 # Object Modeling
  The Jukebox Application utilizes object-oriented programming principles to model various components of the music playback system. Here's an overview of the key objects and their interactions:

  1. Song: Represents a single audio track with properties such as title, artist, album, duration, and file path.
  2. Playlist: Represents a collection of songs grouped together based on user preferences or themes.
  3. Jukebox: Acts as the main controller for managing playlists, controlling playback, and interacting with the user interface.
